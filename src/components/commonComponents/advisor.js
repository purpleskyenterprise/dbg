        <p>We comply with relevant laws, policies, and regulations. Since compliance guidelines vary by locality, organizations must be cognizant of the regulatory and compliance requirements of each locality they operate in. If a business engages in our continuous process to identify and resolve risks, then our structure can be used to support other risk mitigation efforts.  </p>
